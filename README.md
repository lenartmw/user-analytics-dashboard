## User Metric Selection and Filters
The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into Netflix user behaviors and trends and was designed to guide data-driven decisions to enhance the service. It aggregates and visualizes user data, offering a range of metrics and filters to select from.

The drop-down menu *Pick a metric* allows to select one of the key metrics for analysis, including:
* Rating
* Watch Time
* Completion Rate
* Rewatch Rate

These metrics provide insights into how users interact with the content. For example, Watch Time shows the total time users spend watching Netflix, providing insights into user engagement.
The data can be also filtered by:
- Age Group (e.g., 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s)
- Gender (Female or Male)
- Activity Date (using a slider to specify the period)
